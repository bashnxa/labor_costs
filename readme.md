âš  **Warning:** The bot sends error messages to a Telegram chat. Do not connect it to public groups, as confidential data from Redmine may be exposed.

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Automated Redmine login** using Selenium  
- **Daily scheduled reports** of logged work hours  
- **Custom reminders** for employees who haven't logged enough time
